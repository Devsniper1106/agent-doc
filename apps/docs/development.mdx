## Introduction

Novel's codebase is set up in a monorepo (via [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)) and is fully [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/steven-tey/novel).

Here's the monorepo structure:

```
apps
├── docs
├── web
packages
├── headless
├── tailwind-config
```

### Step 1: Local setup

First, clone the [Dub repo](https://dub.sh/github)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/steven-tey/novel
```

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm i
```

Install Mintlify CLI (for docs server):

```bash
pnpm i -g mintlify
```

### Step 2: Start the development server

Finally, you can start the development server. This will build the packages + start the app servers.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 3: Use Generative AI Local (Optional)

You can use Ollama to run your local AI server.\

```bash
# You cand find the config in the web app
/api/generate/route.ts
```
